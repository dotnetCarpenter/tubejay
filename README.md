This is an experiment using youtube.com video files to create a VJ interface for live mixing videos.  
The code was originally developed by [halfd](http://github.com/halfd "halfd's github page").

<strong>Ideas for futher development:</strong>

+  Implement search for myspace.com videos
+  Auto play (for continues play-back on slow Internet connections)
+  HTML5 canvas
